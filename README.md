# What is Langchain ?

LangChain is a framework built to help you build LLM-powered applications more easily by providing you with the following:

![langchain](https://github.com/ra9hur/Langchain-Modules/assets/17127066/739967e3-beb9-4cdc-bbd7-67041b6cddef)

- a generic interface to a variety of different foundation models (Models),
- a framework to help you manage your prompts (Prompts), and
- a central interface to long-term memory (Memory), external data (Indexes), other LLMs (Chains), and other agents for tasks an LLM is not able to handle (e.g., calculations or search) (Agents).

It is an open-source project ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)) created by Harrison Chase.

Because LangChain has a lot of different functionalities, it may be challenging to understand what it does at first. A huge shout to [Aithra Sen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOrU905yPYXItzOax1OUsgkehvlM7wIK5) for creating a YouTube series that has made things a lot simpler to understand and implement.
